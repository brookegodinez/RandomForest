# RandomForest
This is my portion of a project of Natural Language Processing project completed for a Data Mining Techniques class. This is a from scratch random forest that uses out of bag error to estimate the correct prediction of a category for a code bug decription. Resulted in a 83.3 percent error rate, likely due to the limited amount of data used for our project.
